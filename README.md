**Author:** Tif Taylor | **Class:** Code Fellows 201 | **Date:** July 2020

**About:**
This was a class code-a-long around building a basic wire-frame for a project page. 

**Resources:**
- Most of the HTML and CSS was done with the class during the code-a-long 
- I used this [w3schools link](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp) to learn how to soften the corners of the button on the page per the dev mock-up in the assignment
